Dear <%= realname %>,

We received this document but it appears to be unsigned. Please print, sign, scan, and email the scanned pdf to secretary@apache.org. Alternatively, you can create a detached, ascii-armored pgp signature and send both the document and the signature to secretary@apache.org. 

Warm Regards,
